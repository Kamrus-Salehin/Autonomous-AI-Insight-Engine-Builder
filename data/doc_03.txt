The Water Cycle Explained
The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It's a closed system, meaning that the total amount of water on Earth remains relatively constant, constantly recycling through different states and locations.

Key Stages of the Water Cycle:

Evaporation: The process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas (water vapor) and rises into the atmosphere. This primarily occurs from oceans, lakes, rivers, and soil, driven by energy from the sun.

Transpiration: A specific type of evaporation where water vapor is released from plants' leaves into the atmosphere.

Sublimation: The process where ice or snow changes directly into water vapor without first melting into liquid water, occurring mainly in cold, dry, and windy conditions.

Condensation: As water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools and changes back into tiny liquid water droplets or ice crystals, forming clouds. This occurs when the air becomes saturated with water vapor and reaches its dew point.

Precipitation: When the water droplets or ice crystals in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth in various forms, including rain, snow, sleet, or hail.

Collection/Accumulation: Once precipitation reaches the Earth's surface, it collects in various places:

Oceans, Lakes, and Rivers: Most water flows into these bodies of water, ready to evaporate again.

Groundwater: Some water soaks into the ground, becoming groundwater, which can be stored in aquifers or flow into rivers and streams underground.

Runoff: Water that flows over the land surface, eventually making its way into streams, rivers, and oceans.

Ice Caps and Glaciers: In colder regions, precipitation may accumulate as ice and snow, forming glaciers and ice caps, where it can be stored for long periods.

This continuous movement ensures the Earth's water supply is constantly replenished and circulated.
