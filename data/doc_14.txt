Our Solar System: Planets and Key Features
Our Solar System consists of the Sun, its eight planets and their natural satellites, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets, all gravitationally bound to the Sun. It formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago from the collapse of a giant molecular cloud.

The Sun:

Type: A yellow dwarf star, the center of our Solar System.

Composition: Primarily hydrogen (about 70%) and helium (about 28%).

Significance: Provides the light and heat essential for life on Earth through nuclear fusion. Its immense gravity holds all the planets and other objects in orbit.

The Eight Planets (in order from the Sun):

Mercury:

Type: Inner, rocky (terrestrial) planet.

Key Features: Smallest planet, no atmosphere (leading to extreme temperature swings), heavily cratered surface, fastest orbit around the Sun.

Venus:

Type: Inner, rocky (terrestrial) planet.

Key Features: Often called Earth's "sister planet" due to similar size and composition. Extremely hot and has a thick, toxic atmosphere primarily of carbon dioxide, leading to a runaway greenhouse effect. Rotates backward.

Earth:

Type: Inner, rocky (terrestrial) planet.

Key Features: The only known planet to harbor life. Unique for its abundance of liquid water, an oxygen-rich atmosphere, and diverse ecosystems. Has one natural satellite, the Moon.

Mars:

Type: Inner, rocky (terrestrial) planet.

Key Features: Known as the "Red Planet" due to iron oxide on its surface. Has a thin atmosphere, polar ice caps, and evidence of past liquid water, suggesting potential for past microbial life. Two small moons: Phobos and Deimos.

Jupiter:

Type: Outer, gas giant.

Key Features: Largest planet in the Solar System, more than twice as massive as all other planets combined. Famous for its Great Red Spot (a persistent storm larger than Earth) and numerous moons, including the four Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto). Has a faint ring system.

Saturn:

Type: Outer, gas giant.

Key Features: Renowned for its spectacular, extensive, and complex system of rings, composed mainly of ice particles and rocky debris. Second-largest planet, with many moons, including Titan (the second-largest moon in the Solar System, with a thick atmosphere).

Uranus:

Type: Outer, ice giant.

Key Features: Rotates on its side (tilted nearly 90 
âˆ˜
  to its orbit), possibly due to a ancient collision. Has a faint ring system and numerous moons. Appears blue-green due to methane in its atmosphere.

Neptune:

Type: Outer, ice giant.

Key Features: The farthest planet from the Sun. Known for its strong winds, dynamic storms (like the Great Dark Spot, though less persistent than Jupiter's), and faint ring system. Its largest moon, Triton, orbits backward.

Other Key Components:

Dwarf Planets: Objects large enough to be rounded by their own gravity but have not cleared their orbital path (e.g., Pluto, Eris, Ceres).

Asteroid Belt: Located between Mars and Jupiter, containing millions of rocky objects (asteroids).

Kuiper Belt: A region beyond Neptune, home to many icy bodies, including dwarf planets like Pluto.

Oort Cloud: A hypothetical spherical cloud of icy objects far beyond the Kuiper Belt, believed to be the source of long-period comets.
