  "query": "What are the stages of water cycle?",
  "answer": "- **Evaporation**: Water changes from liquid to gas (water vapor) and rises into the atmosphere, primarily from oceans, lakes, rivers, and soil, driven by solar energy.  \n- **Transpiration**: Water vapor is released from plants' leaves into the atmosphere.  \n- **Sublimation**: Ice or snow directly changes into water vapor without melting, occurring in cold, dry, and windy conditions.  \n- **Condensation**: Water vapor cools and forms liquid droplets or ice crystals, creating clouds.  \n- **Precipitation**: Water droplets or ice crystals fall as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.  \n- **Collection/Accumulation**: Precipitation collects in oceans, lakes, rivers, groundwater, runoff, or as ice caps and glaciers.",
